# UNCC_FinTech_Class3
Class 3 Practice Exercises

I'm Aaron Galloway, founder and CEO of InfiniGift, and a current student in the August cohort of the UNCC FinTech Bootcamp

My goal is to find joy wherever joy can be found. I've found that I love to learn and love to create. The lessons I'll pickup in this class fit perfectly.

Both of my parents are engineers. It could be said that FinTech chose me!
